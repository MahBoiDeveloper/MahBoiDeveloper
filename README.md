### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
[![Support me on Boosty](https://img.shields.io/badge/boosty-50â‚½/month-green.svg?logo=boosty)](https://boosty.to/mah_boi)

I'm a fan of [Command & Conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer) games and mods for them, who enjoys translating mods into Russian and helping to develop community modding tools, such as the [XNA CnCNet Client](https://github.com/CnCNet/xna-cncnet-client). Previously, I wrote a lot of articles for [CnCSeries.ru](https://cncseries.ru), which you can read [here](https://cncseries.ru/author/mah_boi/). Currently working on C&C: Generals â€” Zero Hour [Hotkey Editor](https://github.com/MahBoiDeveloper/GZHHotkeysEditor).

Translated mods by me:
1. [Twisted Insurrection](https://github.com/MahBoiTranslator/TwistedInsurrectionRu)
2. [The Second Tiberium War](https://github.com/MahBoiTranslator/TheSecondTiberiumWarRu)
3. [Rise From The Ashes](https://github.com/MahBoiTranslator/RiseFromTheAshesRu)
4. [Tiberium Essence](https://github.com/MahBoiTranslator/TiberiumEssenceRu)
5. [Generals Evolution](https://github.com/MahBoiTranslator/GeneralsEvolutionRu)

Also you can support me on my [Boosty](https://boosty.to/mah_boi).
